## EKG

EKG is a monitoring tool that can monitor various aspect of GHC's runtime
alongside an active process. The interface for the output is viewable within a
browser interface. The monitoring process is forked off (in a system thread)
from the main process.

```haskell
{-# Language OverloadedStrings #-}

import Control.Monad
import System.Remote.Monitoring

main :: IO ()
main = do
  ekg <- forkServer "localhost" 8000
  putStrLn "Started server on http://localhost:8000"
  forever $ getLine >>= putStrLn
```

## RTSプロファイリング

The GHC runtime system can be asked to dump information about

```haskell
$ ./program +RTS -s

       1,939,784 bytes allocated in the heap
          11,160 bytes copied during GC
          44,416 bytes maximum residency (2 sample(s))
          21,120 bytes maximum slop
               1 MB total memory in use (0 MB lost due to fragmentation)

                                    Tot time (elapsed)  Avg pause  Max pause
  Gen  0         2 colls,     0 par    0.00s    0.00s     0.0000s    0.0000s
  Gen  1         2 colls,     0 par    0.00s    0.00s     0.0002s    0.0003s

  INIT    time    0.00s  (  0.00s elapsed)
  MUT     time    0.00s  (  0.01s elapsed)
  GC      time    0.00s  (  0.00s elapsed)
  EXIT    time    0.00s  (  0.00s elapsed)
  Total   time    0.01s  (  0.01s elapsed)

  %GC     time       5.0%  (7.1% elapsed)

  Alloc rate    398,112,898 bytes per MUT second

  Productivity  91.4% of total user, 128.8% of total elapsed
```

Productivity indicates the amount of time spent during execution compared to the
time spent garbage collecting. Well tuned CPU bound programs are often in the
90-99% range of productivity range.

In addition individual function profiling information can be generated by
compiling the program with ``-prof`` flag. The resulting information is
outputted to a ``.prof`` file of the same name as the module. This is useful for
tracking down hotspots in the program.

```haskell
$ ghc -O2 program.hs -prof -auto-all
$ ./program +RTS -p
$ cat program.prof
        Mon Oct 27 23:00 2014 Time and Allocation Profiling Report  (Final)

           program +RTS -p -RTS

        total time  =        0.01 secs   (7 ticks @ 1000 us, 1 processor)
        total alloc =   1,937,336 bytes  (excludes profiling overheads)
