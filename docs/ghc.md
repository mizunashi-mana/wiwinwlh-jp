# GHC

## ブロック図

The flow of code through GHC is a process of translation between several
intermediate languages and optimizations and transformations thereof. A common
pattern for many of these AST types is they are parametrised over a binder type
and at various stages the binders will be transformed, for example the Renamer
pass effectively translates the ``HsSyn`` datatype from a AST parametrized over
literal strings as the user enters into a ``HsSyn`` parameterized over qualified
names that includes modules and package names into a higher level Name type.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sdiehl/wiwinwlh/master/img/ghc.png)

* **Parser/Frontend**: An enormous AST translated from human syntax that makes
  explicit possible all expressible syntax ( declarations, do-notation, where
  clauses, syntax extensions, template haskell, ... ). This is unfiltered
  Haskell and it is *enormous*.
* **Renamer** takes syntax from the frontend and transforms all names to be
  qualified (``base:Prelude.map`` instead of ``map``) and any shadowed names in
  lambda binders transformed into unique names.
* **Typechecker** is a large pass that serves two purposes, first is the core type
  bidirectional inference engine where most of the work happens and the
  translation between the frontend ``Core`` syntax.
* **Desugarer** translates several higher level syntactic constructors
    * ``where`` statements are turned into (possibly recursive) nested ``let``
      statements.
    * Nested pattern matches are expanded out into splitting trees of case
      statements.
    * do-notation is expanded into explicit bind statements.
    * Lots of others.
* **Simplifier** transforms many Core constructs into forms that are more
  adaptable to compilation. For example let statements will be floated or
  raised, pattern matches will simplified, inner loops will be pulled out and
  transformed into more optimal forms. Non-intuitively the resulting may
  actually be much more complex (for humans) after going through the simplifier!
* **Stg** pass translates the resulting Core into STG (Spineless Tagless
   G-Machine) which effectively makes all laziness explicit and encodes the
   thunks and update frames that will be handled during evaluation.
* **Codegen/Cmm** pass will then translate STG into Cmm (flavoured C--) a simple
  imperative language that manifests the low-level implementation details of
  runtime types. The runtime closure types and stack frames are made explicit
  and low-level information about the data and code (arity, updatability, free
  variables, pointer layout) made manifest in the info tables present on most
  constructs.
* **Native Code** The final pass will than translate the resulting code into
  either LLVM or Assembly via either through GHC's home built native code
  generator (NCG) or the LLVM backend.

Information for about each pass can dumped out via a rather large collection of
flags. The GHC internals are very accessible although some passes are somewhat
easier to understand than others. Most of the time ``-ddump-simpl`` and
``-ddump-stg`` are sufficient to get an understanding of how the code will
compile, unless of course you're dealing with very specialized optimizations or
hacking on GHC itself.

Core is the explicitly typed System-F family syntax through that all Haskell
constructs can be expressed in.

To inspect the core from GHCi we can invoke it using the following flags and the
following shell alias. We have explicitly disable the printing of certain
metadata and longform names to make the representation easier to read.

```bash
alias ghci-core="ghci -ddump-simpl -dsuppress-idinfo \
-dsuppress-coercions -dsuppress-type-applications \
-dsuppress-uniques -dsuppress-module-prefixes"
```

At the interactive prompt we can then explore the core representation interactively:

```bash
$ ghci-core
λ: let f x = x + 2 ; f :: Int -> Int

==================== Simplified expression ====================
returnIO
  (: ((\ (x :: Int) -> + $fNumInt x (I# 2)) `cast` ...) ([]))

λ: let f x = (x, x)

==================== Simplified expression ====================
returnIO (: ((\ (@ t) (x :: t) -> (x, x)) `cast` ...) ([]))
```

[ghc-core](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/ghc-core) is also very useful for
looking at GHC's compilation artifacts.

```bash
$ ghc-core --no-cast --no-asm
```

Alternatively the major stages of the compiler ( parse tree, core, stg, cmm, asm
) can be manually outputted and inspected by passing several flags to the
compiler:

```bash
$ ghc -ddump-to-file -ddump-parsed -ddump-simpl -ddump-stg -ddump-cmm -ddump-asm
```

**Reading Core**

Core from GHC is roughly human readable, but it's helpful to look at simple
human written examples to get the hang of what's going on.

```haskell
id :: a -> a
id x = x
```

```haskell
id :: forall a. a -> a
id = \ (@ a) (x :: a) -> x

idInt :: GHC.Types.Int -> GHC.Types.Int
idInt = id @ GHC.Types.Int
```

```haskell
compose :: (b -> c) -> (a -> b) -> a -> c
compose f g x = f (g x)
```

```haskell
compose :: forall b c a. (b -> c) -> (a -> b) -> a -> c
compose = \ (@ b) (@ c) (@ a) (f1 :: b -> c) (g :: a -> b) (x1 :: a) -> f1 (g x1)
```

```haskell
map :: (a -> b) -> [a] -> [b]
map f []     = []
map f (x:xs) = f x : map f xs
```

```haskell
map :: forall a b. (a -> b) -> [a] -> [b]
map =
  \ (@ a) (@ b) (f :: a -> b) (xs :: [a]) ->
    case xs of _ {
      []     -> [] @ b;
      : y ys -> : @ b (f y) (map @ a @ b f ys)
    }
```

Machine generated names are created for a lot of transformation of Core.
Generally they consist of a prefix and unique identifier. The prefix is often
pass specific ( i.e. ``ds`` for desugar generated name s) and sometimes specific
names are generated for specific automatically generated code. A non exhaustive
cheat sheet is given below for deciphering what a name is and what it might
stand for:

| Prefix     | Description |
| :--------: | :-----------:
| ``$f...``  | Dict-fun identifiers (from inst decls) |
| ``$dmop``  | Default method for 'op' |
| ``$wf``    | Worker for function 'f' |
| ``$sf``    | Specialised version of f |
| ``$gdm``   | Generated class method |
| ``$d``     | Dictionary names |
| ``$s``     | Specialized function name |
| ``$f``     | Foreign export |
| ``$pnC``   | n'th superclass selector for class C |
| ``T:C``    | Tycon for dictionary for class C |
| ``D:C``    | Data constructor for dictionary for class C |
| ``NTCo:T`` | Coercion for newtype T to its underlying runtime representation |

Of important note is that the Λ and λ for type-level and value-level lambda
abstraction are represented by the same symbol (``\``) in core, which is a
simplifying detail of the GHC's implementation but a source of some confusion
when starting.

```haskell
-- System-F Notation
Λ b c a. λ (f1 : b -> c) (g : a -> b) (x1 : a). f1 (g x1)

-- Haskell Core
\ (@ b) (@ c) (@ a) (f1 :: b -> c) (g :: a -> b) (x1 :: a) -> f1 (g x1)
```

The ``seq`` function has an intuitive implementation in the Core language.

```haskell
x `seq` y
```

```haskell
case x of _ {
  __DEFAULT -> y
}
```

One particularly notable case of the Core desugaring process is that pattern matching on overloaded numbers
implicitly translates into equality test (i.e. ``Eq``).

```haskell
f 0 = 1
f 1 = 2
f 2 = 3
f 3 = 4
f 4 = 5
f _ = 0


f :: forall a b. (Eq a, Num a, Num b) => a -> b
f =
  \ (@ a)
    (@ b)
    ($dEq :: Eq a)
    ($dNum :: Num a)
    ($dNum1 :: Num b)
    (ds :: a) ->
    case == $dEq ds (fromInteger $dNum (__integer 0)) of _ {
      False ->
        case == $dEq ds (fromInteger $dNum (__integer 1)) of _ {
          False ->
            case == $dEq ds (fromInteger $dNum (__integer 2)) of _ {
              False ->
                case == $dEq ds (fromInteger $dNum (__integer 3)) of _ {
                  False ->
                    case == $dEq ds (fromInteger $dNum (__integer 4)) of _ {
                      False -> fromInteger $dNum1 (__integer 0);
                      True -> fromInteger $dNum1 (__integer 5)
                    };
                  True -> fromInteger $dNum1 (__integer 4)
                };
              True -> fromInteger $dNum1 (__integer 3)
            };
          True -> fromInteger $dNum1 (__integer 2)
        };
      True -> fromInteger $dNum1 (__integer 1)
    }
```

Of course, adding a concrete type signature changes the desugar just matching on the unboxed values.

```haskell
f :: Int -> Int
f =
  \ (ds :: Int) ->
    case ds of _ { I# ds1 ->
    case ds1 of _ {
      __DEFAULT -> I# 0;
      0 -> I# 1;
      1 -> I# 2;
      2 -> I# 3;
      3 -> I# 4;
      4 -> I# 5
    }
    }
```

```

Having to enter a secondary closure every time we used ``($)`` would introduce
an enormous overhead. Fortunately GHC has a pass to eliminate small functions
like this by simply replacing the function call with the body of it's definition
at appropriate call-sites. There compiler contains a variety heuristics for
determining when this kind of substitution is appropriate and the potential
costs involved.

In addition to the automatic inliner, manual pragmas are provided for more
granular control over inlining.  It's important to note that naive inlining
quite often results in significantly worse performance and longer compilation
times.

```haskell
{-# INLINE func #-}
{-# INLINABLE func #-}
{-# NOINLINE func #-}
```

For example the contrived case where we apply a binary function to two
arguments. The function body is small and instead of entering another closure
just to apply the given function, we could in fact just inline the function
application at the call site.

```haskell
{-# INLINE foo #-}
{-# NOINLINE bar #-}

foo :: (a -> b -> c) -> a -> b -> c
foo f x y = f x y

bar :: (a -> b -> c) -> a -> b -> c
bar f x y = f x y

test1 :: Int
test1 = foo (+) 10 20

test2 :: Int
test2 = bar (+) 20 30
```

Looking at the core, we can see that in ``test2`` the function has indeed been
expanded at the call site and simply performs the addition there instead of
another indirection.

```haskell
test1 :: Int
test1 =
  let {
    f :: Int -> Int -> Int
    f = + $fNumInt } in
  let {
    x :: Int
    x = I# 10 } in
  let {
    y :: Int
    y = I# 20 } in
  f x y

test2 :: Int
test2 = bar (+ $fNumInt) (I# 20) (I# 30)
```

Cases marked with ``NOINLINE`` generally indicate that the logic in the function
is using something like ``unsafePerformIO`` or some other unholy function. In
these cases naive inlining might duplicate effects at multiple call-sites
throughout the program which would be undesirable.

## 辞書

The Haskell language defines the notion of Typeclasses but is agnostic to how
they are implemented in a Haskell compiler. GHC's particular implementation uses
a pass called the *dictionary passing translation* part of the elaboration phase
of the typechecker which translates Core functions with typeclass constraints
into implicit parameters of which record-like structures containing the function
implementations are passed.

```haskell
class Num a where
  (+) :: a -> a -> a
  (*) :: a -> a -> a
  negate :: a -> a
```

This class can be thought as the implementation equivalent to the following
parameterized record of functions.

```haskell
data DNum a = DNum (a -> a -> a) (a -> a -> a) (a -> a)

add (DNum a m n) = a
mul (DNum a m n) = m
neg (DNum a m n) = n

numDInt :: DNum Int
numDInt = DNum plusInt timesInt negateInt

numDFloat :: DNum Float
numDFloat = DNum plusFloat timesFloat negateFloat
```

```haskell
+ :: forall a. Num a => a -> a -> a
+ = \ (@ a) (tpl :: Num a) ->
  case tpl of _ { D:Num tpl _ _ -> tpl }

* :: forall a. Num a => a -> a -> a
* = \ (@ a) (tpl :: Num a) ->
  case tpl of _ { D:Num _ tpl _ -> tpl }

negate :: forall a. Num a => a -> a
negate = \ (@ a) (tpl :: Num a) ->
  case tpl of _ { D:Num _ _ tpl -> tpl }
```

``Num`` and ``Ord`` have simple translation but for monads with existential type
variables in their signatures, the only way to represent the equivalent
dictionary is using ``RankNTypes``. In addition a typeclass may also include
superclasses which would be included in the typeclass dictionary and
parameterized over the same arguments and an implicit superclass constructor
function is created to pull out functions from the superclass for the current
monad.

```haskell
data DMonad m = DMonad
  { bind   :: forall a b. m a -> (a -> m b) -> m b
  , return :: forall a. a -> m a
  }
```

```haskell
class (Functor t, Foldable t) => Traversable t where
    traverse :: Applicative f => (a -> f b) -> t a -> f (t b)
    traverse f = sequenceA . fmap f
```

```haskell
data DTraversable t = DTraversable
  { dFunctorTraversable :: DFunctor t  -- superclass dictionary
  , dFoldableTraversable :: DFoldable t -- superclass dictionary
  , traverse :: forall a. Applicative f => (a -> f b) -> t a -> f (t b)
  }
```

Indeed this is not that far from how GHC actually implements typeclasses. It
elaborates into projection functions and data constructors nearly identical to
this, and are implicitly threaded for every overloaded identifier.

## 特殊化

Overloading in Haskell is normally not entirely free by default, although with
an optimization called specialization it can be made to have zero cost at
specific points in the code where performance is crucial. This is not enabled by
default by virtue of the fact that GHC is not a whole-program optimizing
compiler and most optimizations ( not all ) stop at module boundaries.

GHC's method of implementing typeclasses means that explicit dictionaries are
threaded around implicitly throughout the call sites. This is normally the most
natural way to implement this functionality since it preserves separate
compilation. A function can be compiled independently of where it is declared,
not recompiled at every point in the program where it's called. The dictionary
passing allows the caller to thread the implementation logic for the types to
the call-site where it can then be used throughout the body of the function.

Of course this means that in order to get at a specific typeclass function we
need to project ( possibly multiple times ) into the dictionary structure to
pluck out the function reference. The runtime makes this very cheap but not
entirely free.

Many C++ compilers or whole program optimizing compilers do the opposite
however, they explicitly specialize each and every function at the call site
replacing the overloaded function with it's type-specific implementation. We can
selectively enable this kind of behavior using class specialization.

```haskell
module Specialize (spec, nonspec, f) where

{-# SPECIALIZE INLINE f :: Double -> Double -> Double #-}

f :: Floating a => a -> a -> a
f x y = exp (x + y) * exp (x + y)

nonspec :: Float
nonspec = f (10 :: Float) (20 :: Float)

spec :: Double
spec = f (10 :: Double) (20 :: Double)
```

**Non-specialized**

```haskell
f :: forall a. Floating a => a -> a -> a
f =
  \ (@ a) ($dFloating :: Floating a) (eta :: a) (eta1 :: a) ->
    let {
      a :: Fractional a
      a = $p1Floating @ a $dFloating } in
    let {
      $dNum :: Num a
      $dNum = $p1Fractional @ a a } in
    * @ a
      $dNum
      (exp @ a $dFloating (+ @ a $dNum eta eta1))
      (exp @ a $dFloating (+ @ a $dNum eta eta1))
```

In the specialized version the typeclass operations placed directly at the call
site and are simply unboxed arithmetic. This will map to a tight set of
sequential CPU instructions and is very likely the same code generated by C.

```haskell
spec :: Double
spec = D# (*## (expDouble# 30.0) (expDouble# 30.0))
```

The non-specialized version has to project into the typeclass dictionary
(``$fFloatingFloat``) 6 times and likely go through around 25 branches to
perform the same operation.

```haskell
nonspec :: Float
nonspec =
  f @ Float $fFloatingFloat (F# (__float 10.0)) (F# (__float 20.0))
```

For a tight loop over numeric types specializing at the call site can result in
orders of magnitude performance increase. Although the cost in compile-time can
often be non-trivial and when used function used at many call-sites this can
slow GHC's simplifier pass to a crawl.

The best advice is profile and look for large uses of dictionary projection in
tight loops and then specialize and inline in these places.

Using the ``SPECIALISE INLINE`` pragma can unintentionally cause GHC to diverge
if applied over a recursive function, it will try to specialize itself
infinitely.

## 静的コンパイル

On Linux, Haskell programs can be compiled into a standalone statically linked
binary that includes the runtime statically linked into it.

```bash
$ ghc -O2 --make -static -optc-static -optl-static -optl-pthread Example.hs
$ file Example
Example: ELF 64-bit LSB executable, x86-64, version 1 (GNU/Linux), statically linked, for GNU/Linux 2.6.32, not stripped
$ ldd Example
        not a dynamic executable

```

In addition the file size of the resulting binary can be reduced by stripping
unneeded symbols.

```bash
$ strip Example
```

## 非ボックス型

The usual numerics types in Haskell can be considered to be a regular algebraic
datatype with special constructor arguments for their underlying unboxed values.
Normally unboxed types and explicit unboxing are not used in normal code, they
are an implementation detail of the compiler and many optimizations exist to do
the unboxing in a way that is guaranteed to be safe and preserve the high level
semantics of Haskell. Nevertheless it is somewhat enlightening to understand how
the types are implemented.

```haskell
data Int = I# Int#

data Integer
  = S# Int#              -- Small integers
  | J# Int# ByteArray#   -- Large GMP integers

data Float = F# Float#
```

```haskell
λ: :set -XMagicHash
λ: :m +GHC.Types
λ: :m +GHC.Prim

λ: :type 3#
3# :: GHC.Prim.Int#

λ: :type 3##
3## :: GHC.Prim.Word#

λ: :type 3.14#
3.14# :: GHC.Prim.Float#

λ: :type 3.14##
3.14## :: GHC.Prim.Double#

λ: :type 'c'#
'c'# :: GHC.Prim.Char#

λ: :type "Haskell"#
"Haskell"# :: Addr#

λ: :i Int
data Int = I# Int#      -- Defined in GHC.Types

λ: :k Int#
Int# :: #
```

An unboxed type with kind ``#`` and will never unify a type variable of kind
``*``. Intuitively a type with kind ``*`` indicates a type with a uniform
runtime representation that can be used polymorphically.

* *Lifted* - Can contain a bottom term, represented by a pointer. ( ``Int``, ``Any``, ``(,)`` )
* *Unlited* - Cannot contain a bottom term, represented by a value on the stack. ( ``Int#``, ``(#, #)`` )

```haskell
{-# LANGUAGE BangPatterns, MagicHash, UnboxedTuples #-}

import GHC.Exts
import GHC.Prim

ex1 :: Bool
ex1 = gtChar# a# b#
  where
    !(C# a#) = 'a'
    !(C# b#) = 'b'

ex2 :: Int
ex2 = I# (a# +# b#)
  where
    !(I# a#) = 1
    !(I# b#) = 2

ex3 :: Int
ex3 = (I# (1# +# 2# *# 3# +# 4#))

ex4 :: (Int, Int)
ex4 = (I# (dataToTag# False), I# (dataToTag# True))
```

The function for integer arithmetic used in the ``Num`` typeclass for ``Int`` is
just pattern matching on this type to reveal the underlying unboxed value,
performing the builtin arithmetic and then performing the packing up into
``Int`` again.

```haskell
plusInt :: Int -> Int -> Int
(I# x) `plusInt` (I# y) = I# (x +# y)
```

Where ``(+#)`` is a low level function built into GHC that maps to intrinsic
integer addition instruction for the CPU.

```haskell
plusInt :: Int -> Int -> Int
plusInt a b = case a of {
    (I# a_) -> case b of {
      (I# b_) -> I# (+# a_ b_);
    };
};
```

Runtime values in Haskell are by default represented uniformly by a boxed
``StgClosure*`` struct which itself contains several payload values, which can
themselves either be pointers to other boxed values or to unboxed literal values
that fit within the system word size and are stored directly within the closure
in memory. The layout of the box is described by a bitmap in the header for the
closure which describes which values in the payload are either pointers or
non-pointers.

The ``unpackClosure#`` primop can be used to extract this information at runtime
by reading off the bitmap on the closure.

```haskell
{-# LANGUAGE MagicHash, UnboxedTuples #-}
{-# OPTIONS_GHC -O1 #-}

module Main where

import GHC.Exts
import GHC.Base
import Foreign

data Size = Size
  { ptrs  :: Int
  , nptrs :: Int
  , size  :: Int
  } deriving (Show)

unsafeSizeof :: a -> Size
unsafeSizeof a =
  case unpackClosure# a of
    (# x, ptrs, nptrs #) ->
      let header  = sizeOf (undefined :: Int)
          ptr_c   = I# (sizeofArray# ptrs)
          nptr_c  = I# (sizeofByteArray# nptrs) `div` sizeOf (undefined :: Word)
          payload = I# (sizeofArray# ptrs +# sizeofByteArray# nptrs)
          size    = header + payload
      in Size ptr_c nptr_c size

data A = A {-# UNPACK #-} !Int
data B = B Int

main :: IO ()
main = do
  print (unsafeSizeof (A 42))
  print (unsafeSizeof (B 42))
```

For example the datatype with the ``UNPACK`` pragma contains 1 non-pointer and 0
pointers.

```haskell
data A = A {-# UNPACK #-} !Int
Size {ptrs = 0, nptrs = 1, size = 16}
```

While the default packed datatype contains 1 pointer and 0 non-pointers.

```haskell
data B = B Int
Size {ptrs = 1, nptrs = 0, size = 9}
```

The closure representation for data constructors are also "tagged" at the
runtime with the tag of the specific constructor. This is however not a runtime
type tag since there is no way to recover the type from the tag as all
constructor simply use the sequence (0, 1, 2, ...). The tag is used to
discriminate cases in pattern matching. The builtin ``dataToTag#`` can  be used
to pluck off the tag for an arbitrary datatype. This is used in some cases when
desugaring pattern matches.

```haskell
dataToTag# :: a -> Int#
```

For example:

```haskell
-- data Bool = False | True
-- False ~ 0
-- True  ~ 1

a :: (Int, Int)
a = (I# (dataToTag# False), I# (dataToTag# True))
-- (0, 1)

-- data Ordering = LT | EQ | GT
-- LT ~ 0
-- EQ ~ 1
-- GT ~ 2

b :: (Int, Int, Int)
b = (I# (dataToTag# LT), I# (dataToTag# EQ), I# (dataToTag# GT))
-- (0, 1, 2)

-- data Either a b = Left a | Right b
-- Left ~ 0
-- Right ~ 1

c :: (Int, Int)
c = (I# (dataToTag# (Left 0)), I# (dataToTag# (Right 1)))
-- (0, 1)
```

String literals included in the source code are also translated into several
primop operations. The ``Addr#`` type in Haskell stands for a static contagious
buffer pre-allocated on the Haskell heap that can hold a ``char*`` sequence. The
operation ``unpackCString#`` can scan this buffer and fold it up into a list of
Chars from inside Haskell.

```haskell
unpackCString# :: Addr# -> [Char]
```

This is done in the early frontend desugarer phase, where literals are
translated into ``Addr#`` inline instead of giant chain of Cons'd characters. So
our "Hello World" translates into the following Core:

```haskell
-- print "Hello World"
print (unpackCString# "Hello World"#)
```

## IOとST

Both the IO and the ST monad have special state in the GHC runtime and share a
very similar implementation. Both ``ST a`` and ``IO a`` are passing around an
unboxed tuple of the form:

```haskell
(# token, a #)
```

The ``RealWorld#`` token is "deeply magical" and doesn't actually expand into
any code when compiled, but simply threaded around through every bind of the IO
or ST monad and has several properties of being unique and not being able to be
duplicated to ensure sequential IO actions are actually sequential.
``unsafePerformIO`` can thought of as the unique operation which discards the
world token and plucks the ``a`` out, and is as the name implies not normally
safe.

The ``PrimMonad`` abstracts over both these monads with an associated data
family for the world token or ST thread, and can be used to write operations
that generic over both ST and IO.  This is used extensively inside of the vector
package to allow vector algorithms to be written generically either inside of IO
or ST.

```haskell
{-# LANGUAGE MagicHash #-}
{-# LANGUAGE UnboxedTuples #-}

import GHC.IO ( IO(..) )
import GHC.Prim ( State#, RealWorld )
import GHC.Base ( realWorld# )

instance  Monad IO  where
    m >> k    = m >>= \ _ -> k
    return    = returnIO
    (>>=)     = bindIO
    fail s    = failIO s

returnIO :: a -> IO a
returnIO x = IO $ \ s -> (# s, x #)

bindIO :: IO a -> (a -> IO b) -> IO b
bindIO (IO m) k = IO $ \ s -> case m s of (# new_s, a #) -> unIO (k a) new_s

thenIO :: IO a -> IO b -> IO b
thenIO (IO m) k = IO $ \ s -> case m s of (# new_s, _ #) -> unIO k new_s

unIO :: IO a -> (State# RealWorld -> (# State# RealWorld, a #))
unIO (IO a) = a
```

```haskell
{-# LANGUAGE MagicHash #-}
{-# LANGUAGE UnboxedTuples #-}
{-# LANGUAGE TypeFamilies #-}

import GHC.IO ( IO(..) )
import GHC.ST ( ST(..) )
import GHC.Prim ( State#, RealWorld )
import GHC.Base ( realWorld# )

class Monad m => PrimMonad m where
  type PrimState m
  primitive :: (State# (PrimState m) -> (# State# (PrimState m), a #)) -> m a
  internal :: m a -> State# (PrimState m) -> (# State# (PrimState m), a #)

instance PrimMonad IO where
  type PrimState IO = RealWorld
  primitive = IO
  internal (IO p) = p

instance PrimMonad (ST s) where
  type PrimState (ST s) = s
  primitive = ST
  internal (ST p) = p
```

## ghc-heap-view

Through some dark runtime magic we can actually inspect the ``StgClosure``
structures at runtime using various C and Cmm hacks to probe at the fields of
the structure's representation to the runtime. The library ``ghc-heap-view`` can
be used to introspect such things, although there is really no use for this kind
of thing in everyday code it is very helpful when studying the GHC internals to
be able to inspect the runtime implementation details and get at the raw bits
underlying all Haskell types.

```haskell
{-# LANGUAGE MagicHash #-}

import GHC.Exts
import GHC.HeapView

import System.Mem

main :: IO ()
main = do
  -- Constr
  clo <- getClosureData $! ([1,2,3] :: [Int])
  print clo

  -- Thunk
  let thunk = id (1+1)
  clo <- getClosureData thunk
  print clo

  -- evaluate to WHNF
  thunk `seq` return ()

  -- Indirection
  clo <- getClosureData thunk
  print clo

  -- force garbage collection
  performGC

  -- Value
  clo <- getClosureData thunk
  print clo
```

A constructor (in this for cons constructor of list type) is represented by a
``CONSTR`` closure that holds two pointers to the head and the tail. The integer
in the head argument is a static reference to the pre-allocated number and we
see a single static reference in the SRT (static reference table).

```haskell
ConsClosure {
  info = StgInfoTable {
    ptrs = 2,
    nptrs = 0,
    tipe = CONSTR_2_0,
    srtlen = 1
  },
  ptrArgs = [0x000000000074aba8/1,0x00007fca10504260/2],
  dataArgs = [],
  pkg = "ghc-prim",
  modl = "GHC.Types",
  name = ":"
}
```

We can also observe the evaluation and update of a thunk in process ( ``id (1+1)`` ). The initial thunk is simply a thunk type with a pointer to the code
to evaluate it to a value.

```haskell
ThunkClosure {
  info = StgInfoTable {
    ptrs = 0,
    nptrs = 0,
    tipe = THUNK,
    srtlen = 9
  },
  ptrArgs = [],
  dataArgs = []
}
```

When forced it is then evaluated and replaced with an Indirection closure which
points at the computed value.

```haskell
BlackholeClosure {
  info = StgInfoTable {
    ptrs = 1,
    nptrs = 0,
    tipe = BLACKHOLE,
    srtlen = 0
  },
  indirectee = 0x00007fca10511e88/1
}
```

When the copying garbage collector passes over the indirection, it then simply
replaces the indirection with a reference to the actual computed value computed
by ``indirectee`` so that future access does need to chase a pointer through the
indirection pointer to get the result.

```haskell
ConsClosure {
  info = StgInfoTable {
    ptrs = 0,
    nptrs = 1,
    tipe = CONSTR_0_1,
    srtlen = 0
  },
  ptrArgs = [],
  dataArgs = [2],
  pkg = "integer-gmp",
  modl = "GHC.Integer.Type",
  name = "S#"
}
```

## STG

After being compiled into Core, a program is translated into a very similar
intermediate form known as STG ( Spineless Tagless G-Machine ) an abstract
machine model that makes all laziness explicit. The spineless indicates that
function applications in the language do not have a spine of applications of
functions are collapsed into a sequence of arguments. Currying is still present
in the semantics since arity information is stored and partially applied
functions will evaluate differently than saturated functions.

```haskell
-- Spine
f x y z = App (App (App f x) y) z

-- Spineless
f x y z = App f [x, y, z]
```

All let statements in STG bind a name to a *lambda form*. A lambda form with no
arguments is a thunk, while a lambda-form with arguments indicates that a
closure is to be allocated that captures the variables explicitly mentioned.

Thunks themselves are either reentrant (``\r``) or updatable (``\u``) indicating
that the thunk and either yields a value to the stack or is allocated on the
heap after the update frame is evaluated All subsequent entry's of the thunk
will yield the already-computed value without needing to redo the same work.

A lambda form also indicates the *static reference table* a collection of
references to static heap allocated values referred to by the body of the
function.

For example turning on ``-ddump-stg`` we can see the expansion of the following
compose function.

```haskell
-- Frontend
compose f g = \x -> f (g x)
```

```haskell
-- Core
compose :: forall t t1 t2. (t1 -> t) -> (t2 -> t1) -> t2 -> t
compose =
  \ (@ t) (@ t1) (@ t2) (f :: t1 -> t) (g :: t2 -> t1) (x :: t2) ->
    f (g x)
```

```haskell
-- STG
compose :: forall t t1 t2. (t1 -> t) -> (t2 -> t1) -> t2 -> t =
    \r [f g x] let { sat :: t1 = \u [] g x; } in  f sat;
SRT(compose): []
```

For a more sophisticated example, let's trace the compilation of the factorial
function.

```haskell
-- Frontend
fac :: Int -> Int -> Int
fac a 0 = a
fac a n = fac (n*a) (n-1)
```

```haskell
-- Core
Rec {
fac :: Int -> Int -> Int
fac =
  \ (a :: Int) (ds :: Int) ->
    case ds of wild { I# ds1 ->
    case ds1 of _ {
      __DEFAULT ->
        fac (* @ Int $fNumInt wild a) (- @ Int $fNumInt wild (I# 1));
      0 -> a
    }
    }
end Rec }
```

```haskell
-- STG
fac :: Int -> Int -> Int =
    \r srt:(0,*bitmap*) [a ds]
        case ds of wild {
          I# ds1 ->
              case ds1 of _ {
                __DEFAULT ->
                    let {
                      sat :: Int =
                          \u srt:(1,*bitmap*) []
                              let { sat :: Int = NO_CCS I#! [1]; } in  - $fNumInt wild sat; } in
                    let { sat :: Int = \u srt:(1,*bitmap*) [] * $fNumInt wild a;
                    } in  fac sat sat;
                0 -> a;
              };
        };
SRT(fac): [fac, $fNumInt]
```

Notice that the factorial function allocates two thunks ( look for ``\u``)
inside of the loop which are updated when computed. It also includes static
references to both itself (for recursion) and the dictionary for instance of
``Num`` typeclass over the type ``Int``.

## ワーカとラッパ

With ``-O2`` turned on GHC will perform a special optimization known as the
Worker-Wrapper transformation which will split the logic of the factorial
function across two definitions, the worker will operate over stack unboxed
allocated machine integers which compiles into a tight inner loop while the
wrapper calls into the worker and collects the end result of the loop and
packages it back up into a boxed heap value. This can often be an order of of
magnitude faster than the naive implementation which needs to pack and unpack
the boxed integers on every iteration.

```haskell
-- Worker
$wfac :: Int# -> Int# -> Int# =
    \r [ww ww1]
        case ww1 of ds {
          __DEFAULT ->
              case -# [ds 1] of sat {
                __DEFAULT ->
                    case *# [ds ww] of sat { __DEFAULT -> $wfac sat sat; };
              };
          0 -> ww;
        };
SRT($wfac): []

-- Wrapper
fac :: Int -> Int -> Int =
    \r [w w1]
        case w of _ {
          I# ww ->
              case w1 of _ {
                I# ww1 -> case $wfac ww ww1 of ww2 { __DEFAULT -> I# [ww2]; };
              };
        };
SRT(fac): []
```

## Zエンコーディング

The Z-encoding is Haskell's convention for generating names that are safely
represented in the compiler target language. Simply put the z-encoding renames
many symbolic characters into special sequences of the z character.

| String    | Z-Encoded String |
| :-------: | :--------------: |
| ``foo``   | ``foo`` |
| ``z``     | ``zz`` |
| ``Z``     | ``ZZ`` |
| ``.``     | ``.`` |
| ``()``    | ``Z0T`` |
| ``(,)``   | ``Z2T`` |
| ``(,,)``  | ``Z3T`` |
| ``_``     | ``zu`` |
| ``(``     | ``ZL`` |
| ``)``     | ``ZR`` |
| ``:``     | ``ZC`` |
| ``#``     | ``zh`` |
| ``.``     | ``zi`` |
| ``(#,#)`` | ``Z2H`` |
| ``(->)``  | ``ZLzmzgZR`` |

In this way we don't have to generate unique unidentifiable names for character
rich names and can simply have a straightforward way to translate them into
something unique but identifiable.

So for some example names from GHC generated code:

| Z-Encoded String                      | Decoded String |
| :-----------------------------------: | :------------: |
| ``ZCMain_main_closure``               | ``:Main_main_closure`` |
| ``base_GHCziBase_map_closure``        | ``base_GHC.Base_map_closure`` |
| ``base_GHCziInt_I32zh_con_info``      | ``base_GHC.Int_I32#_con_info`` |
| ``ghczmprim_GHCziTuple_Z3T_con_info`` | ``ghc-prim_GHC.Tuple_(,,)_con_in`` |
| ``ghczmprim_GHCziTypes_ZC_con_info``  | ``ghc-prim_GHC.Types_:_con_info`` |

## Cmm

Cmm is GHC's complex internal intermediate representation that maps directly
onto the generated code for the compiler target. Cmm code code generated from
Haskell is CPS-converted, all functions never return a value, they simply call
the next frame in the continuation stack. All evaluation of functions proceed by
indirectly jumping to a code object with it's arguments placed on the stack by
the caller.

This is drastically different than C's evaluation model, where are placed on the
stack and a function yields a value to the stack after it returns.

There are several common suffixes you'll see used in all closures and function
names:

| Symbol  | Meaning |
| :-----: | :-----: |
| ``0``   | No argument |
| ``p``   | Garage Collected Pointer |
| ``n``   | Word-sized non-pointer |
| ``l``   | 64-bit non-pointer (long) |
| ``v``   | Void |
| ``f``   | Float |
| ``d``   | Double |
| ``v16`` | 16-byte vector |
| ``v32`` | 32-byte vector |
| ``v64`` | 64-byte vector |

**Cmm Registers**

There are 10 registers that described in the machine model. **Sp** is the
pointer to top of the stack, **SpLim** is the pointer to last element in the
stack. **Hp** is the heap pointer, used for allocation and garbage collection
with **HpLim** the current heap limit.

The **R1** register always holds the active closure, and subsequent registers
are arguments passed in registers. Functions with more than 10 values spill into
memory.

* Sp
* SpLim
* Hp
* HpLim
* HpAlloc
* R1
* R2
* R3
* R4
* R5
* R6
* R7
* R8
* R9
* R10

**Examples**

To understand Cmm it is useful to look at the code generated by the equivalent
Haskell and slowly understand the equivalence and mechanical translation maps
one to the other.

There are generally two parts to every Cmm definition, the **info table** and
the **entry code**. The info table maps directly ``StgInfoTable`` struct and
contains various fields related to the type of the closure, it's payload, and
references. The code objects are basic blocks of generated code that correspond
to the logic of the Haskell function/constructor.

For the simplest example consider a constant static constructor. Simply a
function which yields the Unit value. In this case the function is simply a
constructor with no payload, and is statically allocated.

Haskell:

```haskell
unit = ()
```

Cmm:

```cpp
[section "data" {
     unit_closure:
         const ()_static_info;
 }]
```

Consider a static constructor with an argument.

Haskell:

```haskell
con :: Maybe ()
con = Just ()
```

Cmm:

```cpp
[section "data" {
     con_closure:
         const Just_static_info;
         const ()_closure+1;
         const 1;
 }]
```

Consider a literal constant. This is a static value.

Haskell:

```haskell
lit :: Int
lit = 1
```

Cmm:

```cpp
[section "data" {
     lit_closure:
         const I#_static_info;
         const 1;
 }]
```

Consider the identity function.

Haskell:

```haskell
id x = x
```

Cmm:

```cpp
[section "data" {
     id_closure:
         const id_info;
 },
 id_info()
         { label: id_info
           rep:HeapRep static { Fun {arity: 1 fun_type: ArgSpec 5} }
         }
     ch1:
         R1 = R2;
         jump stg_ap_0_fast; // [R1]
 }]
```

Consider the constant function.

Haskell:

```haskell
constant x y = x
```

Cmm:

```cpp
[section "data" {
     constant_closure:
         const constant_info;
 },
 constant_info()
         { label: constant_info
           rep:HeapRep static { Fun {arity: 2 fun_type: ArgSpec 12} }
         }
     cgT:
         R1 = R2;
         jump stg_ap_0_fast; // [R1]
 }]
```

Consider a function where application of a function ( of unknown arity ) occurs.

Haskell:

```haskell
compose f g x = f (g x)
```

Cmm:

```cpp
[section "data" {
     compose_closure:
         const compose_info;
 },
 compose_info()
         { label: compose_info
           rep:HeapRep static { Fun {arity: 3 fun_type: ArgSpec 20} }
         }
     ch9:
         Hp = Hp + 32;
         if (Hp > HpLim) goto chd;
         I64[Hp - 24] = stg_ap_2_upd_info;
         I64[Hp - 8] = R3;
         I64[Hp + 0] = R4;
         R1 = R2;
         R2 = Hp - 24;
         jump stg_ap_p_fast; // [R1, R2]
     che:
         R1 = compose_closure;
         jump stg_gc_fun; // [R1, R4, R3, R2]
     chd:
         HpAlloc = 32;
         goto che;
 }]
```

Consider a function which branches using pattern matching:

Haskell:

```haskell
match :: Either a a -> a
match x = case x of
  Left a -> a
  Right b -> b
```

Cmm:

```cpp
[section "data" {
     match_closure:
         const match_info;
 },
 sio_ret()
         { label: sio_info
           rep:StackRep []
         }
     ciL:
         _ciM::I64 = R1 & 7;
         if (_ciM::I64 >= 2) goto ciN;
         R1 = I64[R1 + 7];
         Sp = Sp + 8;
         jump stg_ap_0_fast; // [R1]
     ciN:
         R1 = I64[R1 + 6];
         Sp = Sp + 8;
         jump stg_ap_0_fast; // [R1]
 },
 match_info()
         { label: match_info
           rep:HeapRep static { Fun {arity: 1 fun_type: ArgSpec 5} }
         }
     ciP:
         if (Sp - 8 < SpLim) goto ciR;
         R1 = R2;
         I64[Sp - 8] = sio_info;
         Sp = Sp - 8;
         if (R1 & 7 != 0) goto ciU;
         jump I64[R1]; // [R1]
     ciR:
         R1 = match_closure;
         jump stg_gc_fun; // [R1, R2]
     ciU: jump sio_info; // [R1]
 }]
```

**Macros**

Cmm itself uses many macros to stand for various constructs, many of which are
defined in an external C header file. A short reference for the common types:

| Cmm     | Description |
| :-----: | :---------: |
| ``C_``  | char |
| ``D_``  | double |
| ``F_``  | float |
| ``W_``  | word |
| ``P_``  | garbage collected pointer |
| ``I_``  | int |
| ``L_``  | long |
| ``FN_`` | function pointer (no arguments) |
| ``EF_`` | extern function pointer |
| ``I8``  | 8-bit integer |
| ``I16`` | 16-bit integer |
| ``I32`` | 32-bit integer |
| ``I64`` | 64-bit integer |

Many of the predefined closures (``stg_ap_p_fast``, etc) are themselves
mechanically generated and more or less share the same form ( a giant switch
statement on closure type, update frame, stack adjustment). Inside of GHC is a
file named ``GenApply.hs`` that generates most of these functions.  See the Gist
link in the reading section for the current source file that GHC generates.  For
example the output for ``stg_ap_p_fast``.

```cpp
stg_ap_p_fast
{   W_ info;
    W_ arity;
    if (GETTAG(R1)==1) {
        Sp_adj(0);
        jump %GET_ENTRY(R1-1) [R1,R2];
    }
    if (Sp - WDS(2) < SpLim) {
        Sp_adj(-2);
        W_[Sp+WDS(1)] = R2;
        Sp(0) = stg_ap_p_info;
        jump __stg_gc_enter_1 [R1];
    }
    R1 = UNTAG(R1);
    info = %GET_STD_INFO(R1);
    switch [INVALID_OBJECT .. N_CLOSURE_TYPES] (TO_W_(%INFO_TYPE(info))) {
        case FUN,
             FUN_1_0,
             FUN_0_1,
             FUN_2_0,
             FUN_1_1,
             FUN_0_2,
             FUN_STATIC: {
            arity = TO_W_(StgFunInfoExtra_arity(%GET_FUN_INFO(R1)));
            ASSERT(arity > 0);
            if (arity == 1) {
                Sp_adj(0);
                R1 = R1 + 1;
                jump %GET_ENTRY(UNTAG(R1)) [R1,R2];
            } else {
                Sp_adj(-2);
                W_[Sp+WDS(1)] = R2;
                if (arity < 8) {
                  R1 = R1 + arity;
                }
                BUILD_PAP(1,1,stg_ap_p_info,FUN);
            }
        }
        default: {
            Sp_adj(-2);
            W_[Sp+WDS(1)] = R2;
            jump RET_LBL(stg_ap_p) [];
        }
    }
}
```

Handwritten Cmm can be included in a module manually by first compiling it
through GHC into an object and then using a special FFI invocation.

```cpp
#include "Cmm.h"

factorial {
  entry:
      W_ n  ;
      W_ acc;
      n = R1 ;
      acc = n ;
      n = n - 1 ;

  for:
      if (n <= 0 ) {
          RET_N(acc);
      } else {
          acc = acc * n  ;

**Tables Next to Code**

GHC will place the info table for a toplevel closure directly next to the
entry-code for the objects in memory such that the fields from the info table
can be accessed by pointer arithmetic on the function pointer to the code
itself. Not performing this optimization would involve chasing through one more
pointer to get to the info table. Given how often info-tables are accessed using
the tables-next-to-code optimization results in a tractable speedup.

**Pointer Tagging**

Depending on the type of the closure involved, GHC will utilize the last few
bits in a pointer to the closure to store information that can be read off from
the bits of pointer itself before jumping into or access the info tables. For
thunks this can be information like whether it is evaluated to WHNF or not, for
constructors it contains the constructor tag (if it fits) to avoid an info table
lookup.

Depending on the architecture the tag bits are either the last 2 or 3 bits of a
pointer.

```cpp
// 32 bit arch
TAG_BITS = 2

// 64-bit arch
TAG_BITS = 3
```

These occur in Cmm most frequently via the following macro definitions:

```cpp
#define TAG_MASK ((1 << TAG_BITS) - 1)
#define UNTAG(p) (p & ~TAG_MASK)
#define GETTAG(p) (p & TAG_MASK)
```

So for instance in many of the precompiled functions, there will be a test for
whether the active closure ``R1`` is already evaluated.

```cpp
if (GETTAG(R1)==1) {
    Sp_adj(0);
    jump %GET_ENTRY(R1-1) [R1,R2];
}
```
